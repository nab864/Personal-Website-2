      <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
      <div class="hobbysubsection">
        <h2>Baking:</h2>
        <p>There's something truly magical about the alchemy of flour, water, and yeast coming together to create a perfectly risen sourdough loaf. From the satisfying crackle of a crispy crust 
          to the soft, pillowy crumb within, baking sourdough is a labor of love that never fails to bring me joy. But my culinary adventures don't stop there. Whether it's crafting decadent 
          cookies filled with chunks of chocolate or whipping up a batch of dough for homemade pizza, I find solace and creativity in the kitchen.</p>

      <div class="hobbysubsection">
        <h2>Rock Climbing:</h2>
        <p>There's an unparalleled thrill that comes with pushing my physical and mental limits, testing my strength and agility against nature's rugged terrain. Whether I'm tackling bouldering 
          problems, ascending towering cliffs, or navigating intricate indoor routes, rock climbing offers a sense of freedom and accomplishment like no other. </p>

      <div class="hobbysubsection">
        <h2>Video Games:</h2>
        <p>From the immersive worlds of role-playing games to the pulse-pounding action of first-person shooters, gaming has been a source of joy and inspiration for me since childhood. Whether 
          I'm embarking on epic quests to save the world or competing with friends in fast-paced multiplayer matches, each gaming experience offers a unique opportunity to escape reality and 
          explore new worlds filled with adventure and excitement. </p>
